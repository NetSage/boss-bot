#H1Boss Bot for Discord

A pretty simple bot with an sqlite database for managing the data.  Currenlty just picks a random quote from the DB and sends a message containing into discord.

Will try to add some features after the database for raids is at least done (but it's been normalized for dungeons already).

I'm thinking requesting specific expansion/instance/boss lines.  And possibly some ports for different games eventually (LOTRO would be cool I think).

Shout out to the [WarCraft Wiki](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft_Wiki).  It's been where I've been getting the quotes from so thanks to all that contribute to that project.  I was very surprised wowhead didn't seem to have it automated or provide an easy API (or blizzard for that matter).

Also small shoout out too [Codedex](https://www.codedex.io/home) who showed me how easy a discord bot is to actually start.
